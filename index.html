<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/philipd/story-creator">Story Creator</a></h3>

<p>Story Creator is a multi-page web database application I built with one of my classmates as mid-term project for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp. It provides a platform for collaborative story-telling; users can begin stories, contribute to other users' stories, select from submitted contributions to one&rsquo;s own story, and upvote other users' contributions. It utilizes Express, PostGresQL, and jQuery.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/uselesswordbot">Useless Word Bot</a></h3>

<p>The Useless Word Bot was a Python script that generated words &ldquo;not yet in the English language&rdquo; and posted one to Twitter every ten minutes. It utilized a technique similar to Markov Chaining to produce strings which, despite conforming to common patterns of letters in English, were nevertheless not actual English words. While the bot stopped tweeting years ago after Twitter updated their API, the bot&rsquo;s account is still online.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/philipd/payroll-utility">Payroll Utility</a></h3>

<p>While working as an assistant manager for an independent resto-cafe in 2012, I wrote a command-line utility in Python that interfaced with our workforce management application&rsquo;s API to flag possible timesheet errors and calculate tip distributions.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/philipd/oceanic-feeling">Oceanic Feeling</a></h3>

<p>For Edmonton&rsquo;s 2011 <em>Sea of Sound</em> festival, I used Processing&ndash;a Java-based language and framework for multimedia artists&ndash;to develop a program that generated live visuals based on input from a laptop webcam and MIDI controller. For the performance, I improvised live electronic music while my collaborator manipulated the visuals. 3D glasses were distributed to members of the audience.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/philipd/crossbones">Crossbones</a></h3>

<p>As my capstone project for NAIT&rsquo;s NET diploma program in 2011, I collaborated with a classmate to build a peer-to-peer audio streaming application in C# for Windows 7 which allowed users on a local area network to browse each other&rsquo;s shared folders and listen to audio files.</p>
